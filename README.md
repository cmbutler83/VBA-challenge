# VBA Homework: The VBA of Wall Street

## Background

You are well on your way to becoming a programmer and Excel master! In this homework assignment, you will use VBA scripting to analyze generated stock market data. Depending on your comfort level with VBA, you may choose to challenge yourself with a few of the challenge tasks.


### Files


* [Stock Data Macro Enabled Workbook](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SIAk7F_6vc3uH7A4k7-vjfRq7TpW_Nxd/view?usp=share_link) - Ran my scripts on this data to generate the final homework report.
* [VBA Script File](https://github.com/cmbutler83/VBA-challenge/blob/main/stockcode-%20VBA%20script%20file.bas)


## Instructions

Create a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:

  * The ticker symbol.

  * Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The total stock volume of the stock.

**Note:** Make sure to use conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.

## Bonus

Added functionality to your script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume". 


Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script to allow it to run on every worksheet (that is, every year) just by running the VBA script once.


## Submission


  * A screen shot for each year of your results on the multi-year stock data.

  * VBA scripts as separate file.
